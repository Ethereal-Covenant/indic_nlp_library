# Indic NLP Library

This repository is a fork of the original [Indic NLP Library](https://github.com/anoopkunchukuttan/indic_nlp_library) and is integrates [UrduHack](https://github.com/urduhack/urduhack) submodule directly. This allows to work with Urdu normalization and tokenization without needing to install [urduhack](https://pypi.org/project/urduhack/) separately, which can be an issue sometimes as it is `TensorFlow` based. I am mainly maintaining this repository for [IndicTrans2](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/IndicTrans2). 

For any queries, please contact the original authors/maintainers of the respective libraries:
